I was contacted by Freedom mortgage several times to do a refinance on my existing home loan. I spoke to two different lenders. The first person I never called back becuase I did not feel that the savings was enough to justify the fees. The several person worked numbers and got to a number that seemed reasonable. I explained that I may not be staying in the home for more than 8 months. After the refi was done I received a check that I did not ask for. I called and they stated this was mine to keep. After I started paying my mortgage I am now told that my payment is increasing over {$100.00} due to an escrow shortage. I feel that I was intentionally mislead about the payment to book the loan and that the insurance was left out to increase the loan after the loan closed. The escrow should have increased {$19.00} per month not over {$100.00} due to a change in insurance premium from {$820.00} to {$1000.00}. I was not willing to close on the loan and pay the fees unless I had substantial savings and I feel that they were deceptive just to get the extra fees. I would have never refinanced the loan for such a small savings monthly. I advised I may not stay in this home several times.
