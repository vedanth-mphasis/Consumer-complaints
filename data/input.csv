I was contacted by Freedom mortgage several times to do a refinance on my existing home loan. I spoke to two different lenders. The first person I never called back becuase I did not feel that the savings was enough to justify the fees. The several person worked numbers and got to a number that seemed reasonable. I explained that I may not be staying in the home for more than 8 months. After the refi was done I received a check that I did not ask for. I called and they stated this was mine to keep. After I started paying my mortgage I am now told that my payment is increasing over {$100.00} due to an escrow shortage. I feel that I was intentionally mislead about the payment to book the loan and that the insurance was left out to increase the loan after the loan closed. The escrow should have increased {$19.00} per month not over {$100.00} due to a change in insurance premium from {$820.00} to {$1000.00}. I was not willing to close on the loan and pay the fees unless I had substantial savings and I feel that they were deceptive just to get the extra fees. I would have never refinanced the loan for such a small savings monthly. I advised I may not stay in this home several times.
"My complaint is with Carrington Mortgage Services. The company is charging property inspection payments of XXXX along with mortgage of XXXX the dates are from XX/XX/XXXX until present, also attorney fees. This makes my payments double. Carrington is also Charges a fee of XXXX unknown."
We started our mortgage with Loan Depot in XX/XX/XXXX. There has been an outstanding property tax balance of {$520.00} ( plus interest now ) since XX/XX/XXXX. We have paid our mortgage on time every month and called Loan Depot almost weekly to see why they haven't processed the payment. It is now up for tax sale since they have no paid the balance ( they fully acknowledge they owe the payment and every week we are promised by 1-2 supervisors that the balance will be paid that now ). They are 4 months late and they keep promising the payment will go out today. We have received multiple tax sale notifications and they still have not paid the taxes.
